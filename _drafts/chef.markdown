## The easy way to become a skillful chef in only four long, expensive years.

A confession: I used to have a fear of cooking. After a series of kitchen
disasters and disappointed romantic partners, I pretty much swore off the
craft. Most recipes I tried to follow online seemed infuriatingly vague. Cooking
shows seemed to gloss over important details and make difficult tasks look
deceptively simple.

When I got married it forced the issue a bit since my wife really wanted us to
cook together. This caused quite a lot of friction because just the thought of
meal planning made me anxious, especially since my wife loves variety and
branching out to experiment with new recipes.

But we figured it out! Here's how.

## Step 1: Subscribe to a meal prep service

Meal prep services like Blue Apron get a lot of flak. People say they're
overpriced, they waste food by giving you the wrong proportions, the food
quality isn't good, etc. Some of these criticisms are probably true **but**
there are benefits that make them worth the price if you are cooking-challenged
like I was. I'm not familiar with all the different services, but for our
service ([Sunbasket](https://sunbasket.com/) I felt like we got our money's
worth because:

* We didn't have to think about meal prep anymore. They automatically chose
  meals for us and sent them regularly unless we told them not to. So it
  actually took more planning to _not_ cook
* They forced us to fit cooking into our schedule. We already paid for the food,
  it already showed up, it already started slowly decaying in our fridge: the
  pressure was on to cook it!
* They cut out the most tedious part of cooking: choosing, gathering, and
  measuring ingredients. We got to dump out a bag of produce and get right to
  work.
* They spelled things out for us. These services aren't designed for
  accomplished chefs, so the instructions are designed with idiots (like me!) in
  mind.
* A big part of cooking is just being comfortable in the kitchen. The service
  forced us to spend more time in the kitchen, so we naturally started feeling
  more comfortable.

We also chose Sunbasket because they do all of that hippy stuff like using
locally-sourced ingredients and recyclable packaging whenever possible, and they
also have a good selection of vegetarian meals each week. But probably most meal
prep services offer the benefits I mentioned above.

Those are all of the benfits that I expected when we signed up, but there are
other, hidden benefits you'll discover once you start regularly using a meal
prep service.

* Prepping with your partner creates regular bonding/teamwork time, which can be
  hard to schedule if you're both busy.
* Coordinating the chopping/cooking/cleaning stages to efficiently finish the
  meal naturally pressures you to become more efficient at these tasks. I used
  to hate chopping and cleaning in particular, since they felt like extra tasks
  that took away from the cooking. Now I find them oddly satisfying.
* You will quickly discover which parts of your kitchen are sub-par and you will
  start developing strong opinions about your cooking tools. The kinds of tools
  I choose and the way I care for them have changed entirely since I started
  this journey.
* You will start noticing the hidden patterns in cooking. I think that this is
  the big secret that most chefs forget when trying to teach. After making your
  100th pasta dish or your 100th salad, you'll find you have an almost
  subconscious sense of what flavors or ingredients are important. You'll know
  how a certain ingredient should be prepared or cooked without looking at the
  recipe. You'll have a hunch which ingredient can be substituted if one is
  missing.

## Step 2: Watch Food Wishes

Once you start feeling comfortable with your meal prep service (you reliably
produce something that tastes good), start watching Chef John's fantastic
cooking show Food Wishes.

This show is in a totally different ball park from the crap on the Food Network.
No panning shots of fake, fancy kitchens, no prettied up chef taking up half the
frame, no array of pre-portioned ingredients in cute little dishes. Just a
close-up of the food, well-edited to show every single step in detail. Chef John
keeps his mistakes in, he shows you his process. I love it when he says, "That's
just you cookin'" because he makes it clear where the process is _precise_ and
where you just need to develop intuition through practice. He knows all of the
gotchas, he seems to anticipate every possible common mistake you could make.

It's the only cooking show I watch now. Cooking shows I watch on the Food
Network always make me think "That looks nice... but when am I actually going to
do that?" But Food Wishes has fundamentally changed how I cook. I "season to
taste" differently, I buy ingredients differently, I chop differently, I no
longer rely on fixed cooking times. His techniques for French toast and
hard-boiled eggs are now the only ones I use. His recipes for shakshuka and
lemon bars are staples in our household.

Once you are comfortable with cooking, Chef John will quick start elevating you
to a more serious level.

## Step 3: Stop using your meal prep service
