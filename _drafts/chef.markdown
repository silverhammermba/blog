## The easy way to become a skillful chef in only four long, expensive years.

A confession: I used to have a fear of cooking. After a series of kitchen
disasters and disappointed romantic partners, I pretty much swore off the
craft. Most recipes I tried to follow online seemed infuriatingly vague. Cooking
shows seemed to gloss over important details and make difficult tasks look
deceptively simple.

When I got married it forced the issue a bit since my wife really wanted us to
cook together. This caused quite a lot of friction because just the thought of
meal planning made me anxious, especially since my wife loves variety and
branching out to experiment with new recipes.

But we figured it out! Here's how.

## Subscribe to a meal prep service

Meal prep services like Blue Apron get a lot of flak. People say they're
overpriced, they waste food by giving you the wrong proportions, the food
quality isn't good, etc. Some of these criticisms are probably true **but**
there are benefits if you are cooking-challenged like I was:

* You don't have to think about meal prep anymore. Usually the service
  automatically chooses meals for you and sends them regularly
* They force you to fit cooking into your schedule. You already paid for the
  food, it already showed up, it already started slowly decaying in your fridge:
  the pressure is on to cook it!
* They (usually) cut out the most tedious part of cooking: gathering and
  measuring ingredients.
* They (usually) spell things out for you. These services aren't designed for
  accomplished chefs, so the instructions are designed with idiots (like me!) in
  mind.
* A big part of cooking is just being comfortable in the kitchen. If the service
  forces you to spend more time in the kitchen, you're going to start feeling
  more comfortable.

These are the problems that our meal prep service solved for us. If you care, we
specifically subscribed to [Sunbasket](https://sunbasket.com/). I chose it
because they do all of that hippy stuff like using locally-sourced ingredients
and recyclable packaging whenever possible, and they also have a good selection
of vegetarian meals each week.

There are other, hidden benefits you'll discover once you start regularly using
a meal prep service.

* Prepping with your partner creates regular bonding/teamwork time, which can be
  hard to schedule if you're both busy.
* Coordinating the chopping/cooking/cleaning stages to efficiently finish the
  meal naturally pressures you to become more efficient at these tasks. I used
  to hate chopping and cleaning in particular, since they felt like extra tasks
  that took away from the cooking. Now I find them oddly satisfying.
* You will quickly discover which parts of your kitchen are sub-par and will
  start developing strong opinions about your cooking tools. The kinds of tools
  I choose and the way I care for them have changed entirely since I started
  this journey.
* You will start noticing the hidden patterns in cooking. I think that this is
  the big secret that most chefs forget when trying to teach. After making your
  100th pasta dish or your 100th salad, you'll find you have an almost
  subconscious sense of what flavors or ingredients are important. You'll know
  how a certain ingredient should be prepared or cooked without looking at the
  recipe. You'll have a hunch which ingredient can be substituted if one is
  missing.

## Watch Food Wishes
