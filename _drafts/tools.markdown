Use a building analogy?

Tools are always great: a hammer is good at certain tasks, if you have a hammer
you can choose to use it in the situations where it is helpful. The worst a tool
can be is too specialized, where it is often better to use something else.
People can misuse tools but that's not the tool's fault.

Systems can be good or bad: this is like a strict building process where you
always have to build things in a certain way. That can be good if it enforces
safety and helps you remember important steps, but it can also be bad if that
process is too constrained or one-size-fits-all when your job demands more
flexibility. Once you start using a system, it can be very difficult to stop
using it, or to change it. So even a good system can become bad over time.

It's often impossible to avoid building systems, sometimes you need a system;
but try as hard as possible to avoid making systems when they aren't called for.
Tools are much better.
