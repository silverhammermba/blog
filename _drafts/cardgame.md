Alien Orgy

Card Game

Small Deck of cards, each card has an (alien) body part, and some odd verb like "knead" or "enclose"
Should only be a few different types of parts/verbs, with multiples of each

Each player secretly selects some parts/verbs which are what they want done to
themselves.

Players take turns playing cards on each each other, they pick whether the card is a part or verb
If the part/verb matches one of their secrets, the player responds with Yes/No (in Alien, EEHEHS/MWO)

the player played against keeps that card

no other communication, kind of like Hanabi. The goal is to first figure out
what people's secrets are then get them the right cards

maybe two decks?, one for secrets, one for playing

there needs to be enough cards that card-counting is hard, but a small enough
number to reasonably memorize
