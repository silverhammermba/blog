# features that every language should have

project structure == directory structure. no such thing as a separate file that
explicitly says what files are part of the project or the structure is specified
somewhere other than the directories

mixed paradigm. allow objects, but also functions

everything can have methods. ints, strings, classes, etc. can add methods to
existing objects

built-in testing framework

either fully dynamic (has eval()) or static type inferred

if static, has sum types and pattern matching

if static, has explicit exception handling

first-class regex support

# features that would be cool to see

explicit side-effects like `proc` vs `func`
