## The easy way to become a skillful chef in only four expensive years.

A confession: I used to have a fear of cooking. After a series of kitchen
disasters and disappointed romantic partners, I pretty much swore off the
craft. Most recipes I tried to follow online seemed infuriatingly vague. Cooking
shows seemed to gloss over important details and make difficult tasks look
deceptively simple.

When I got married it forced the issue a bit since my wife&mdash;who also had
very little cooking experience&mdash;really wanted us to cook together. This
caused quite a lot of friction because just the thought of meal planning made me
anxious, especially since my wife loves variety and branching out to experiment
with new recipes.

Eventually, we figured it out. I cannot overemphasize just how much I used to
suck at cooking, so if this process worked for me it will probably work for you.

## Step 1: Have a partner

I don't think you need to be married. Perhaps not even romantically involved.
But you need someone who will stick with you through a long and frustrating
process. You need someone you trust, who will speak freely with you, who you
can bounce ideas off of, and who will help shoulder the burden.

You could _maybe_ skip this step entirely, but the process is going to be much
harder. Here's a secret: anyone that tells you that cooking at home is "quick"
or "easy" is _lying to you_. These people are forgetting that cooking at home
_always_ involves _significantly_ more effort than not cooking at home. You have
to shop for ingredients, chop ingredients, make tricky cooking decisions
on-the-fly, and then clean up everything when you're done. These tasks **take
time** and they **are not easy** (unless you already know what you're doing, in
which case _everything_ is "easy").

Learning to cook doesn't magically remove these time-sinks, it just makes them
more enjoyable. Not knowing what ingredient to use starts off nerve-wracking but
ends up being a fun opportunity to try something new. Making a mistake in a
recipe changes from a disapointment to an opportunity for improvisation.

It's kinda like exercise. If you want to be buff, you can't just "become buff"
and then never go to the gym again. Buff people are buff because their lifestyle
involves spending a lot of time at the gym. If you're reading this because you
thought "I wish I cooked at home more", know that that only comes with a
lifestyle that involves more time spent working with food.

## Step 2: Subscribe to a meal prep service

Meal prep services like Blue Apron get a lot of flak. People say they're
overpriced, they waste food by giving you the wrong proportions, the food
quality isn't good, they don't actually save you much time, etc. Some of these
criticisms are probably true **but** there are benefits that make them worth the
price if you are cooking-challenged like I was. I'm not familiar with all the
different services, but for our service ([Sunbasket](https://sunbasket.com/)) I
felt like we got our money's worth because:

* We didn't have to think about meal prep anymore. They automatically chose
  meals for us and sent them regularly unless we told them not to. So it
  actually took more planning to _not_ cook
* They forced us to fit cooking into our schedule. We already paid for the food,
  it already showed up, it already started slowly decaying in our fridge: the
  pressure was on to cook it!
* They cut out the most tedious part of cooking: choosing, gathering, and
  measuring ingredients. We got to dump out a bag of produce and get right to
  work.
* They spelled things out for us. These services aren't designed for
  accomplished chefs, so the instructions are designed with idiots (like me!) in
  mind.
* A big part of cooking is just being comfortable in the kitchen. The service
  forced us to spend more time in the kitchen, so we naturally started feeling
  more comfortable.

We also chose Sunbasket because they do all of that hippy stuff like using
locally-sourced ingredients and recyclable packaging whenever possible, and they
also have a good selection of vegetarian meals each week. But probably most meal
prep services offer the benefits I mentioned above.

Those are all of the benfits that I _expected_ when we signed up, but there are
other, hidden benefits you'll discover once you start regularly using a meal
prep service.

* Prepping with your partner creates regular bonding/teamwork time, which can be
  hard to schedule if you're both busy.
* Coordinating the chopping/cooking/cleaning stages to quickly get to the eating
  stage naturally pressures you to become more efficient at these tasks. I used
  to hate chopping and cleaning in particular, since they felt like extra tasks
  that took away from the cooking. Now I find them oddly satisfying.
* You will quickly discover which parts of your kitchen are sub-par and you will
  start developing strong opinions about your cooking tools. The kinds of tools
  I choose and the ways I care for them have changed entirely since I started
  this journey.
* Most importantly, you will start noticing the hidden patterns in cooking. I
  think that this is the big secret that most chefs forget when trying to teach.
  After making your 100th pasta dish or your 100th salad, you'll find you have
  an almost subconscious sense of what flavors or ingredients are important.
  You'll know how a certain ingredient should be prepared or cooked without
  looking at the recipe. You'll have a hunch which ingredient can be substituted
  if one is missing.

## Step 3: Watch Food Wishes

Once you start feeling comfortable with your meal prep service (you reliably
produce something that tastes good), start watching Chef John's fantastic
cooking show Food Wishes.

</div>

This show is in a totally different ball park from the fluff on the Food
Network. Chef John never shows you his kitchen, or even his face. He shows you
the food in HD close-up, with each step of the process clearly shown. He never
says "Here's one I made earlier"; the dish you see at the end is the one he
started off with. He doesn't edit out his mistakes, in fact there are whole
videos of his that are experiments gone wrong. Instead he tells you what he
learned from the process and what you should do differently.

One of my favorite catch-phrases of his is "That's just you cookin'" because he
makes it clear where the process is _precise_ and where you need to develop
intuition through practice. He knows all of the gotchas and seems to anticipate
every possible common mistake you could make.

For a long while it was the only cooking show I would watch. Food Network stuff
always made me think "That looks nice... but when am I actually going to
do that?" It felt like they were targeting people who were already good cooks.

But Food Wishes was something that I could understand even as a novice and it
ended up fundamentally changing how I cook. I "season to taste" differently, I
buy ingredients differently, I chop differently, I no longer rely on fixed
cooking times. His techniques for French toast and hard-boiled eggs are now the
only ones I use. His recipes for shakshuka and lemon bars are staples in our
household.

Once you are comfortable with cooking, Chef John will quickly elevate you to a
more serious level.

## Step 4: Stop using your meal prep service

After doing Sunbasket almost every week for three years (remember I said this
was an expensive procedure), I noticed a difference in how we talked about our
Sunbasket meals. Rather than saying "This isn't good", we would say "I would've
made this differently". We started noticing certain recipes, or certain steps in
recipes, where we would reliably deviate from the instructions because we knew
we liked it a different way. We would incorporate techniques we saw on Food
Wishes into our Sunbasket meals.

After maybe another year of that going on, I started escalating. After the
cooking was done and we were enjoying the fruits of our labor I would ask my
wife, "Do you think we could have made this, knowing only the list of the
ingredients (no quantities), the name, and a picture of the end result?" In most
cases she thought the answer was "yes". So we took the plunge.

This is our new cooking process. Whenever we're getting low on food at home, we
log into our Sunbasket account and put our future deliveries on hold. Again, I'm
not sure how other services work, but Sunbasket lets you skip deliveries up to a
month out and they only charge you if you don't skip. Then we look at the menu
for what Sunbasket _would_ have sent us next week and pick a few meals that we
like. For each meal, I copy down a list of its ingredients into our shopping
list (minus what we already have in stock, of course) and save the link to the
recipe for later. Crucially, Sunbasket recipes often come with a sauce or
dressing pre-made, but they still tell you the ingredients (without quantities)
so we can add those to our shopping list too.

After we go shopping, the process is fairly similar to Sunbasket proper. We pull
up the recipe, get out all of the ingredients, and get to work. The main
difference is that we use the recipe a lot less. We try to discuss the dish
ahead of time and agree on a general approach to take, only using the recipe for
help if we're unsure. There's no shame in looking up how to do something, but I
think by distancing ourselves from instructions we can develop better intutition
through trial and error. This has worked out very well for us so far.

<li>Salt-and-pepper tofu stir fry with cashew sauce</li>
</ul>

The key benefit this retains from using a service is that the meal selection
process is very simple. I still get anxious trying to plan out meals with no
assistance. Like, which meals from the infinite selection of possible meals do I
want to make this week? By looking at our hypothetical Sunbasket delivery, we
get three vegetarian meals chosen automatically. If we don't like how they look,
Sunbasket has 2-3 other vegetarian meals to choose from plus a dozen others
involving meat that can usually be adapted. Pre-Sunbasket when we tried to cook
on our own we often fell into a pattern of making the same meals over and over,
but now we still get Sunbasket's variety.

The differences from Sunbasket are mostly positive:

* Now that we buy our own ingredients, we naturally buy and cook in bulk, which
  means we get more leftovers
* Since we control which ingredients we buy, we can also take our own
  preferences and pantry into account
    * Three different recipes call for three different kinds of greens? Screw
      it. Buy a big thing of spinach and use it for all three
    * Got leftover broth from last week? Let's choose a meal involving rice and
      turn it into
      [Chef John's oven fried rice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q576aZQICU)
    * Got leftover Asian carrot slaw from those tofu burgers last week? Carrot
      slaw, meet this week's salt-and-pepper tofu stir fry.
* We do make mistakes. You can see there's quite a bit of excess cream sauce for
  the fettuccine, and I think the spice ratio for the curry was off (too much
  garam masala, not enough turmeric). But these aren't deal-breakers and I think
  we learned from each of them

## What next?

Because I'm a software engineer, I can't help but imagine a service similar to
Sunbasket that only helps with the planning part. It would give you a limited
selection of interesting meals each week to spare you from decision paralysis.
Ideally it would understand how to slightly modify a meal to take advantage of
what you have in your pantry, or similar ingredients needed by other meals that
week. Even better if it had a cloud-based shopping list app so my wife and I can
coordinate ingredient acquisition easier.

I think such a service would be fantastic, but also quite difficult to make. So
for now I'm perfectly happy doing things manually.
