There should be a term for a concept that is so difficult to understand at first
that once you finally grok it you feel compelled to write a little tutorial
explaining it&mdash;inevitably resulting in thousands of nearly identical blog
posts, slideshows, and demos all poorly explaining the same thing.

Examples:

* Ruby's singleton classes
* Haskell's monads
* Vim
* Git
