During a local lull in the pandemic my wife and I attended an indoor event.
People were kinda wearing masks and kinda social distancing, but a couple days
after we got back I felt sick.

It was pretty miserable for a few days. I was constantly tired and my throat
hurt, and I swore it was COVID-19 because I had gotten my flu shot recently.
However my symptoms cleared up for the most part in about a week.
Coincidentally, I had a physical exam schedule a few weeks later. I got blood
work done so I asked if they could do the COVID antibody test while they were at
it. Turns out it wasn't COVID at all! I just had a cold of some kind.

Lucky!
