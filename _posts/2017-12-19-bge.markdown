Kinda off-topic for this blog, but I just finished playing this for the first
time. I bought the HD remake for Xbox360 after seeing people collectively lose
their shit at the Beyond Good & Evil 2 trailer. I figured there must be
something to the original game to prompt such excitement.

It was alright.

I think this might be one of those games that's only _great_ through the lens
of nostalgia. There's some good design, some bad design, some fun parts, and
some frustrating parts. Also I think it's kind of a dick move to give you an
interstellar engine and a camera that tells you information about other planets
and stars and then not let you visit them.

And I know it's a relatively unimportant point, but the title is awful. The game
could not be _more_ within the realm of traditional good versus evil. Those guys
that seem kinda like dicks at the beginning? Turns out they're super evil and
willing to sacrifice any number of innocent people to prolong their own lives.
Every other major character in the game? They're part of the righteous rebellion
willing to risk their lives to fight against the evil guys through _journalism_.

I would cautiously recommend it if you're a huge fan of the action adventure
genre. Otherwise... meh.
