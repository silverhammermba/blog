My cough is worse today. I'm still not really congested and my temperature is
normal. I still feel a bit tired but at least my headache is better.

I took a few aspirin throughout the day. The one weird symptom is that my
stomach feels like... weirdly full sometimes? Maybe that's just because I'm
drinking a lot of water.
