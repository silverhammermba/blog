Days 9 and 10 I generally felt pretty good. I was able to work from a desk
instead of bed finally. I still had a bit of a cough and was occasionally
hocking up phlegm, but nothing too bad.

I'm still very curious if I actually had covid. Hopefully I can get the antibody
test (assuming it's not too expensive). My wife never ended up showing any major
symptoms either.
