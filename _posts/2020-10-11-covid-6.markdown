I slept really well last night. Woke up feeling refreshed, not very congested,
maybe a bit dehydrated. On my mom's recommendation, I stacked a couple of
pillows so that I could sleep slightly sitting up. Perhaps that helped.

Definitely still sick though. Still coughing, still have a runny nose, though
actually a bit better than yesterday. I am very low on energy; I tried helping
out with some kitchen stuff and it was tough, I actually had to take a nap
afterwards.

Still no fever either. I'm starting to get hopeful that this either isn't COVID
or I have a mild case. Either way my wife has been completely unaffected. We've
been making no effort to prevent her catching whatever I have, so even if she
didn't catch it from the same source as me she _should_ be symptomatic by now.
Very strange.
