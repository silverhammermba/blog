I forgot to make an entry yesterday. I felt pretty much healthy other than
extreme exhaustion. I grabbed my laptop and tried to work from bed but even
talking to people on the phone was tiring. I took naps on and off throughout the
day. Still took aspirin throughout the day and NyQuil before bed.

Today, I tried to get up and work from my desk but that almost immediately made
me feel worse. So I got back in bed, which made me feel better, but still
utterly exhausted. I had slightly more energy at the end of the day. Tonight I'm
going to try going without NyQuil.
