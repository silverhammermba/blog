This morning my throat felt worse. Very dry, kind of painful to swallow.
Drinking lots of liquids helps. The headache and fatigue are about the same as
yesterday.

I talked to my friend who is an EMT. He is convinced that COVID causes blood
clots, which is the reason for long-term mental impairment after recovery. He
recommends taking aspirin daily. I figure it can't hurt so I had some friends
drop off some and I took a few.

I took my temperature a few times, no change at all from yesterday.
