This is often paraphrased as "no plan survives contact with the enemy". Wise
words.

I'd like to propose a variant of this saying: no software design survives first
contact with the compiler. Don't spend too much time whiteboarding, writing UML,
etc. Because as soon as you see how the code actually works, how it actually
feels to test it and run it, there is no certainty that your software design
will continue to make sense without modification.
