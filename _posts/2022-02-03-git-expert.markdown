I finally got around to recording my talk about git. This is something I made in
response to seeing so many people using git in a professional setting but
clearly being uncomfortable with how the tool actually works (for example,
keeping backups of their local git repository, frequently creating fresh clones,
etc.).

Hopefully this demystifies some of git's behavior and helps you become a better
developer.
